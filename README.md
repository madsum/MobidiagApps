I have done the first 3 smaller WPF projects as it was asked. After I have done 3 projects, I found many repeating codes. So I decided to make a single WPF that will have all those 3 smaller apps. So you will find 2 visual studio 2019 solution in this git repository. In the git repo, I have 2 branches dev and master. Basically, I developed in the dev branch. When everything is done, I rebase dev branch to the master. 

I used Windows 10, Visual Studio 2019 community edition. These are the latest .NETCore WPF application. For the unit testing, I have used the xUnit framework.
